This repository contains a round trip implementation of E2E encryption method(JWE+JWS). The combination of JWE + JWS ensures integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of the data.

Note : The code samples added have hardcoded keys, which are mainly to explain how things work. It is not a recommended practice to hardcode sensitive information in the code, Please take the necessary measurements to store and access keys.
